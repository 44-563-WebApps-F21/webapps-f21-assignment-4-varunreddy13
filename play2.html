    <h3 class = "CECILY">CECILY</h3>
    <p class = "speech">It would distress me more than I can tell you, dear Gwendolen, if it
            caused you any mental or physical anguish, but I feel bound to point
                out that since Ernest proposed to you he clearly has changed his mind.</p>

         <h3 Class ="GWENDOLEN">GWENDOLEN</h3>
         <p class = "stage-direction">[Meditatively.]</p> <p class = "speech">If the poor fellow has been entrapped into any foolish
              promise I shall consider it my duty to rescue him at once, and with a
            firm hand.</p>

     <h3 class = "CECILY">CECILY</h3>
        <p class = "stage-direction">[Thoughtfully and sadly.]</p> <p class = "speech"> Whatever unfortunate entanglement my dear boy
           may have got into, I will never reproach him with it after we are
           married.</p>

          <h3 Class ="GWENDOLEN">GWENDOLEN</h3>
           <p class = "speech">Do you allude to me, Miss Cardew, as an entanglement? You are
          presumptuous. On an occasion of this kind it becomes more than a moral
              duty to speak one’s mind. It becomes a pleasure.</p>

          <h3 class = "CECILY">CECILY</h3>
          <p class = "speech">Do you suggest, Miss Fairfax, that I entrapped Ernest into an
             engagement? How dare you? This is no time for wearing the shallow mask
            of manners. When I see a spade I call it a spade.</p>

         <h3 Class ="GWENDOLEN">GWENDOLEN</h3>
           <p class = "stage-direction">[Satirically.]</p> <p class = "speech">I am glad to say that I have never seen a spade. It is
          obvious that our social spheres have been widely different.</p>

            <p class = "stage-direction">[Enter Merriman, followed by the footman. He carries a salver, table
          cloth, and plate stand. Cecily is about to retort. The presence of the
         servants exercises a restraining influence, under which both girls
          chafe.]</p>

          <h3 Class ="MERRIMAN"> MERRIMAN</h3>
          <p class = "speech"> Shall I lay tea here as usual, Miss?</p>

            <h3 class = "CECILY">CECILY</h3>
            <p class = "stage-direction"> [Sternly, in a calm voice.]</p><p class = "speech"> Yes, as usual.</p> <p class = "stage-direction">[Merriman begins to clear
           table and lay cloth. A long pause. Cecily and Gwendolen glare at each
                other.]</p>

<h3 Class ="GWENDOLEN">GWENDOLEN</h3>
<p class = "speech">Are there many interesting walks in the vicinity, Miss Cardew?</p>

<h3 class = "CECILY">CECILY</h3>
<p class = "speech">Oh! yes! a great many. From the top of one of the hills quite close one
can see five counties.</p>

<h3 Class ="GWENDOLEN">GWENDOLEN</h3>
<p class = "speech">Five counties! I don’t think I should like that; I hate crowds.</p>
